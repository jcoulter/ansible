There is a bug preventing nextcloud from working over nfs share because of locking. Not sure how I am going to store this on the nas, would samba share work?

- get nextcloud saving on nas
- get swag reverse proxy working

Consider removing the server's gateway altogether so that it can only access the internet through vpn

There is a bug preventing nextcloud from working over nfs share because of locking. Not sure how I am going to store this on the nas, would samba share work?

- make qbit and transmission save completed downloads to same dir for sonarr and radarr
- get nextcloud saving on nas
- get swag reverse proxy working
